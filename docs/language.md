# language

Specifies the SQL dialect to use.

## Usage

```ts
import { format } from 'sql-formatter';

const result = format('SELECT * FROM tbl', { dialect: 'sqlite' });
```

## Options

- `"sql"` - (default) [Standard SQL][]
- `"bigquery"` - [GCP BigQuery][]
- `"db2"` - [IBM DB2][]
- `"hive"` - [Apache Hive][]
- `"mariadb"` - [MariaDB][]
- `"mysql"` - [MySQL][]
- `"n1ql"` - [Couchbase N1QL][]
- `"plsql"` - [Oracle PL/SQL][]
- `"postgresql"` - [PostgreSQL][]
- `"redshift"` - [Amazon Redshift][]
- `"singlestoredb"` - [SingleStoreDB][]
- `"snowflake"` - [Snowflake][]
- `"spark"` - [Spark][]
- `"sqlite"` - [SQLite][sqlite]
- `"transactsql"` or `"tsql"` - [SQL Server Transact-SQL][tsql]
- `"trino"` - [Trino][] (should also work for [Presto][], which is very similar dialect, though technically different)

The default `"sql"` dialect is meant for cases where you don't know which dialect of SQL you're about to format.
It's not an auto-detection, it just supports a subset of features common enough in many SQL implementations.
This might or might not work for your specific dialect.
Better to always pick something more specific if possible.

## Impact on bundle size

Using the `language` option has the downside that the used dialects are determined at runtime
and therefore they all have to be bundled when e.g. building a bundle with Webpack.
This can result in significant overhead when you only need to format one or two dialects.

To solve this problem, version 12 of SQL Formatter introduces a new API,
that allows explicitly importing the dialects.
See docs for [dialect][] option.
